  <h3>1.10 - Build Favicon</h3>
  <h4>by Micah Kennedy</h4>
  <h5>10/11/2023</h5>
  <!--explain in paragraph how you created the favicon and how you added it-->
  <p>The favicon was created using a 32x32 pixelated space. It contains 1024 bits. The borders of the favicon are the colors of the Jamaican flag because it represents my culture. In the inside, there is a blue rose to show behind borders, there is something precious. The rose is blue because blue is my favorite color. It was added to the page using the link element (< link>). </p>
